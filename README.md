Assumptions:

As stated in the requirements:

The parking lot has 25 total spaces.
The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars, and vans.
The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact car spots, and regular spots.
A car can park in a single compact spot or a regular spot.
A van can park, but it will take up 3 regular spots (for simplicity, we don't need to make sure these spots are beside each other).

However, since the exact number of each type of spot was not specified, the following distribution of spots in the parking lot was assumed:

Motorcycle: 5
Compact: 11
Regular: 9
